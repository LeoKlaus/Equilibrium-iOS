# Equilibrium iOS App

This is an iOS client for the API of [Equilibrium](https://github.com/LeoKlaus/Equilibrium), an open source universal remote control.
If you don't know about Equilibrium, I recommend [taking a look at that project first](https://github.com/LeoKlaus/Equilibrium), as this app can only be used with an Equilibrium hub.

The latest release of the iOS app just got approved for TestFlight, you can join here: https://testflight.apple.com/join/dyzEZYMs
